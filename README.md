Welcome to ChipBox's repository, I guess.


ChipBox is a desktop DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) heavily inspired by BeepBox - "an online tool for sketching and sharing instrumental melodies" developed by John Nesky. It will keep BeepBox's conveniency with a more modern UI and the features you'd find in any other DAW.

ChipBox is currently under active development and will be fully released- well... someday, definitely.

There's not much I can show you right now (sorry), though you can watch my progress here or on the official BeepBox Discord.
